## [Deciding What to Try Next](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/OVM4M/deciding-what-to-try-next){:target="_back"}

- When you test your hypothesis on a new set of houses, you find that it makes unacceptably large errors in its predictions. <br/> What should you try next?

   - Get more training examples 
   - Try smaller sets of features
   - Try getting additional features
   - Try adding polynomial featyres
   - Try decreasing λ
   - Try increasing λ

<br/>
- Machine learning diagnostic:
   - Diagnostic: A test that you can run to gain insight what is/isn't working with a learning algorithm, and gain guidance as to how best to improve its performance.

   - Diagnostics can take time to implement, but doing so can be very good use of your time.

   - A diagnostic can sometimes rule out certain courses of action (changes to your learning algorithm) as being unlikely to improve its performance significantly

   - Parquet
      - Parquet stores data in columns, while Avro stores data in a row-based format. By their very nature, column-oriented data stores are optimized for read-heavy analytical workloads, while row-based databases are best for write-heavy transactional workloads.
 
   - Avro
      - An Avro schema is created using JSON format.
AVRO supports timestamps.
Note: Azure Data Factory supports the following file formats (not GZip or TXT).



### [Synapse Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/develop-tables-overview){:target="_back"}


- **Design tables using Synapse SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics**


### [Slowly Choosing Dimension (SCD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/populate-slowly-changing-dimensions-azure-synapse-analytics-pipelines/3-choose-between-dimension-types){:target="_back"}

  - Star schema design theory refers to common SCD types. The most common are Type 1 and Type 2. In practice a dimension table may support a combination of history tracking methods, including Type 3 and Type 6. Let's get to know the difference in these SCD types.

### [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-external-table-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=dedicated){:target="_back"}

   - You have an enterprise data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics.
Using PolyBase, you create an external table named [Ext].[Items] to query Parquet files stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 without importing the data to the data warehouse.
The external table has three columns.
You discover that the Parquet files have a fourth column named ItemID.
Which command should you run to add the ItemID column to the external table?

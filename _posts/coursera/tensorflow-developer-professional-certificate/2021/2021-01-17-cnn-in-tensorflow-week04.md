   > Rock Paper Scissors contains images from a variety of different hands,  from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labelled as such. 
   You can download the [training set here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps.zip), and the [test set here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-test-set.zip). 
   These images have all been generated using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a CGI-based dataset can be used for classification against real images. 
   I also generated a few images that you can use for predictions. You can find them [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-validation.zip).

## Go import 

- go get `<package-name>`

   - 可給 import 的 package 命名！

   ~~~go 
    import (
        toml "github.com/pelletier/go-toml"
    )
   ~~~


- go mod init `name-of-the-model`

   - ex:
      - `go mod init github.com/yuting/exercies`

      - go.mod

         ~~~mod
            module github.com/yuting/exercies

            go 1.14

            require(
                github.com/yuting/kkk `version`
                xorm.io/core `version`
            )
         ~~~


      - 要 import 資料夾下的 package

          ~~~
            root_dir
               |
               |__dir1
               |
               |__dir2
               |
               |--go.mod
          ~~~

         
         ~~~go
           
           import (
             "github.com/yuting/exercies/dir1"
             "github.com/yuting/exercies/dir2"
           )
         
         ~~~


## [Go: init](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/the-go-init-function/){:target="_back"}

> There are times, when creating applications in Go, that you need to be able to set up some form of state on the initial startup of your program. This could involve creating connections to databases, or loading in configuration from locally stored configuration files.

> When it comes to doing this in Go, this is where your init() functions come into play. In this tutorial, we’ll be looking at how you can use this init() function to achieve fame and glory, or more likely to help you to build your next Go based project.
